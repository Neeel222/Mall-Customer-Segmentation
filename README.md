# Mall Customer Segmentation - Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains a project on customer segmentation for a retail mall using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal of this project is to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior to help with targeted marketing and customer service.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial task for retail businesses to understand their customer base better and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. In this project, we use various unsupervised learning techniques to segment mall customers into distinct groups based on their spending patterns.

## Contents

- `mall_customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and implementation of the customer segmentation using K-means clustering and other techniques.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is provided in the `data/` directory. It includes features related to customer demographics and spending behavior.

## Key Techniques Used

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing the data to ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering.
3. **K-means Clustering**: Applying K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments.
4. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Using hierarchical clustering to validate the results of K-means clustering.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilizing PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize the clusters.

## How to Run
